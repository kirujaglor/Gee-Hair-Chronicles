<h2><a id="How Do You Make Natural Dreadlocks">How Do You Make Natural Dreadlocks</a></h2>

<p>Ready to make natural dreadlocks on your hair? Patience is key. The formation of locs varies from eight months to a year or more. In most cases, hair texture determines how fast dreadlocks form. Different hair textures will lock in different rates, therefore, the timeline varies from one person to another. For instance, loc-ing straight or wavy hair may even take up to two years. However, there are different techniques for the formation of locks. Determined by the hair type, hair length, lifestyle, and the size of the lock, each technique will give you the best results. Keep scrolling to check out step-by-step techniques to help you start this style.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The Twist and Rip Technique</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Section Hair</li>
        <p>Divide your hair into sections with uniform thicknesses and secure them with rubber bands.</p>
        <li>Wash Your Hair</li>
        <p>Wash your hair while rubbing it in one direction. It helps create the beginning of dreadlocks formation while creating the right texture.</p>
        <li>Air Dry Your Hair</li>
        <p>Begin drying the wet sections of the hair until it’s completely dry.</p>
        <li>Roll Your Hair Using the Palm of Your Hands</li>
        <p>You begin by ripping apart each tied-off section of the hair and applying wax to the section. Secondly, you roll the hair between your palm until it forms a dreadlock. However, to maintain defined dreads, you have to palm roll your hair each day. Also, it is advisable to not over-roll the hair since the locs become susceptible to disentangling. This technique is a more effective way to create locs by yourself!</p>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>The Backcombing Technique</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Always Start with Clean Hair</li>
        <p>Ensure that your hair is product-free and you can use shampoo and hair conditioner to remove residue from the hair. Also, you can moisturize your hair before drying naturally or using a blow dryer.</p>
        <li>Create Sections to make Dreadlocks</li>
        <li>You can section your hair from the front hairline or nape. Using your fingers or a comb, section your hair into square or triangle shapes with uniform sizes.</li>

    </ul>    

    <li><p><b>The Crochet Method</b></p></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Wash your hair with a residue-free shampoo and let it dry.</li>
        <li>Section your hair according to the lock size and shape of your choice.</li>
        <li>Backcomb the sectioned hair up.</li>
        <li>Place your crochet hook between the hairs and pull. Make sure your hair is dry so that the crochet method will work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Crocheting works well for both textured and straight hair. In case you want to achieve an instant appearance of mature dreadlocks, then this one is for you.</p>

    <p>As you embark on your journey to achieve natural dreadlocks, hair will loosen throughout the days and months, and you will have to twist the loose strands of hair. It is also worth noting that performing loc maintenance methods will keep your style on point. Happy dreadlocking!</p>
